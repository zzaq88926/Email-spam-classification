# OpenSpec Instructions

Instructions for AI coding assistants using OpenSpec for spec-driven development.

## TL;DR Quick Checklist

- Search existing work: `openspec spec list --long`, `openspec list` (use `rg` only for full-text search)
- Decide scope: new capability vs modify existing capability
- Pick a unique `change-id`: kebab-case, verb-led (`add-`, `update-`, `remove-`, `refactor-`)
- Scaffold: `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `design.md` (only if needed), and delta specs per affected capability
- Write deltas: use `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED|RENAMED Requirements`; include at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement
- Validate: `openspec validate [change-id] --strict` and fix issues
- Request approval: Do not start implementation until proposal is approved

## Three-Stage Workflow

### Stage 1: Creating Changes
Create proposal when you need to:
- Add features or functionality
- Make breaking changes (API, schema)
- Change architecture or patterns  
- Optimize performance (changes behavior)
- Update security patterns

**Workflow**
1. Review `openspec/project.md`, `openspec list`, and `openspec list --specs` to understand current context.
2. Choose a unique verb-led `change-id` and scaffold `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, optional `design.md`, and spec deltas under `openspec/changes/<id>/`.
3. Draft spec deltas using `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED Requirements` with at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement.
4. Run `openspec validate <id> --strict` and resolve any issues before sharing the proposal.

### Stage 2: Implementing Changes
Track these steps as TODOs and complete them one by one.
1. **Read proposal.md** - Understand what's being built
2. **Read design.md** (if exists) - Review technical decisions
3. **Read tasks.md** - Get implementation checklist
4. **Implement tasks sequentially** - Complete in order
5. **Confirm completion** - Ensure every item in `tasks.md` is finished before updating statuses
6. **Update checklist** - After all work is done, set every task to `- [x]` so the list reflects reality
7. **Approval gate** - Do not start implementation until the proposal is reviewed and approved

### Stage 3: Archiving Changes
After deployment, create separate PR to:
- Move `changes/[name]/` → `changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-[name]/`
- Update `specs/` if capabilities changed
- Use `openspec archive <change-id> --skip-specs --yes` for tooling-only changes (always pass the change ID explicitly)
- Run `openspec validate --strict` to confirm the archived change passes checks

## Directory Structure

```

├── specs/                  # Current truth - what IS built
│   └── [capability]/       # Single focused capability
│       ├── spec.md         # Requirements and scenarios
│       └── design.md       # Technical patterns
├── changes/                # Proposals - what SHOULD change

│   │   ├── tasks.md        # Implementation checklist
│   │   ├── design.md       # Technical decisions (optional; see criteria)
│   │   └── specs/          # Delta changes
│   │       └── [capability]/
│   │           └── spec.md # ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED
│   └── archive/            # Completed changes
```

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Essential commands
openspec list                  # List active changes
openspec list --specs          # List specifications
openspec show [item]           # Display change or spec
openspec validate [item]       # Validate changes or specs
openspec archive <change-id> [--yes|-y]   # Archive after deployment

# Project management
openspec init [path]           # Initialize OpenSpec
openspec update [path]         # Update instruction files
```

Remember: Specs are truth. Changes are proposals. Keep them in sync.
